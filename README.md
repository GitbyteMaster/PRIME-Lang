## PRIME Programming Language
Prime is a Python-based programming language built for Windows 7 and higher. It is lightweight and executes quickly. To get Prime fully functioning, you must [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the latest Python version.


A normal PRIME script will look like this.
```
//Example [DO NOT USE]

arr names {
"Tom"
"Sara"
};
system.input("");
itm(>system.input);
system.display("The names are:");
system.display(>names);
```
