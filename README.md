## PRIME Programming Language
Prime is a Python-based programming language built for Windows 7 and higher. It is lightweight and executes quickly. To get Prime fully functioning, you must [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the latest Python version.


A normal PRIME script will look like this.
```
//Example [DO NOT USE]
import system

arr names {
"Tom"
"Sara"
};
system.input("");
arr names {
"Tom"
"Sara"
>system.input
};
system.display("The names are:");
system.display(>names);
```

Using PRIME, there are common functions, like text and variables. But now, there are built-in functions for things like opening other files like itself.
```
import system

system.file.direct("C://Users/user/Desktop/Newfile/newfile.prime");
```
& PRIME variable syntax is just as easy to learn.
```
import system

var val = ("Hello World!");
system.display(>val);
```
